# Project Setup Complete

✅ **Godot-Focused Directory Structure Created**

Following Godot 4 best practices and component-driven architecture:

## 📁 Key Directories

- **`autoloads/`** - Singleton scripts (GameManager, EventBus, etc.)
- **`components/`** - Reusable component scripts organized by function
- **`scripts/entities/`** - Entity behavior scripts with inheritance
- **`scripts/systems/`** - Game system managers
- **`scenes/`** - Godot scene files organized by type
- **`data/`** - Game configuration (JSON + .tres resources)
- **`assets/`** - Game resources (textures, audio, fonts)

## 🎯 Architecture Highlights

### Component-Driven Design
- Components as child nodes in entity scenes
- Signal-based communication between components
- Cached component references for performance

### Godot Best Practices
- Typed GDScript throughout
- Scene composition over deep inheritance
- AutoLoad singletons for global systems
- Resource files for data-driven design

### Mobile Optimization
- Touch-friendly UI structure
- Performance-conscious architecture
- Asset organization for mobile builds

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Start with AutoLoads**: Create GameManager and EventBus
2. **Build Base Components**: HealthComponent, MovementComponent
3. **Create Entity Base Classes**: BaseEntity, BaseUnit, BaseBuilding
4. **Implement Core Systems**: WaveSystem, BuildingSystem
5. **Create First Scenes**: Unit, Building, Enemy prefabs

## 📚 Documentation

- **`docs/project_structure.md`** - Complete architecture guide
- **`claude.md`** - Godot development best practices
- **Component READMEs** - Usage guides in each directory
- **Entity patterns** - Inheritance and composition examples

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. Create components in `components/` subdirectories
2. Create entity scripts in `scripts/entities/`
3. Build entity scenes in `scenes/entities/`
4. Configure through data files in `data/`
5. Test and iterate

The project structure now fully supports your component-driven, inheritance-based tower defense roguelike with Godot 4 best practices!
