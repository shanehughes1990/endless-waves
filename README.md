# Endless Waves

A strategic tower defense roguelike mobile game built with Godot 4.4. Defend your stationary base, recruit units, build defensive structures, and survive increasingly difficult waves. Death is inevitable - but each run makes you stronger!

## 🎮 What is Endless Waves?

**Endless Waves** is a roguelike tower defense game where you manage a stationary base under siege from endless enemy waves. Your goal is simple: survive as long as possible while climbing higher in the wave count.

### 🏰 Core Gameplay

- **Defend Your Base**: Your base cannot move - strategic positioning is everything
- **Recruit Units**: Hire infantry, archers, mages, and specialists to defend your perimeter
- **Build Structures**: Construct turret towers, defensive walls, and resource buildings
- **Upgrade Everything**: Enhance your units, buildings, and base capabilities
- **Earn & Spend**: Collect coins to recruit units and construct buildings during each run

### 🔄 Roguelike Progression

- **Death is Permanent**: When your base falls, the run ends completely
- **Grow Stronger**: Coins earned during runs unlock permanent base upgrades
- **Start Better**: Each new run begins with improved base stats from previous deaths
- **Endless Challenge**: See how high you can climb the wave counter
