## üìñ About The Game

**Endless Waves** is an addictive idle roguelike game where your goal is to survive as long as possible against ever-increasing waves of enemies. Death is not the end, but a stepping stone to greater power. Each run earns you coins that you can use to purchase permanent upgrades, allowing you to push further and face even greater challenges in your next life.

This game is built with the **Godot Engine v4.4**.

## ‚öîÔ∏è Gameplay

The core loop is simple yet engaging:

1. **Start a Run:** Jump into the action and face the first wave of enemies.
2. **Survive:** Your character fights automatically. Your strategic choices in the upgrade phase determine your success.
3. **Earn Coins:** Defeat enemies and survive waves to accumulate coins.
4. **Succumb:** Eventually, the relentless hordes will overwhelm you.
5. **Upgrade:** Use the coins from your last run to buy permanent stat boosts for your hero.
6. **Repeat:** Start a new run, stronger than before, and see how many waves you can conquer!
